# Todo Checker

An informal tool to log "todo" comments in a given code file.

The idea for this tool stems from the concept of coloring your code comments based on a certain prefix. *Better Comments* in VSCode is a good example of an extension that does this.

## (Intended) Usage

My vision for this tool is to use it as a way to summarize particular kinds of comments throughout your codebase.

This could be for various reasons, including, but not limited to:
 - Your editor doesn't support colored comments and you want a way to differentiate them.
 - You want a way to quickly check the status of your project.
     - If your coding style is to leave yourself a bunch of notes, then this might be useful.
     - If it isn't, then it probably wouldn't be.
 - Any other reason you may want a slightly more detailed summary of certain comments.
